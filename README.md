# mql-scripts

A reflection and review of Freebase.com and the (now deprecated) Metaweb Query Language (MQL). 


# Sample MQL Scripts

Some samples of MQL scripts that I wrote are enclosed as txt files in the mql-queries folder. 



# The Google Knowledge Graph

Following the deprecation of the Freebase APIs, the new Knowledge Graph Search API was released. The new KG API does not support the use of the MQL as it did on Freebase.
